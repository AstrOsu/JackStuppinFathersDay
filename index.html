            Jack Stuppin was an artist who was never afraid to make mistakes, instead he saw mistakes as a way to improve.  He always had the dardenst things to say about everything, for example he encrougaed making mistakes on purpose so that you could use those as an oppurtunity to grow.  That's one of the reasons he preferred art professionalism to his other career pursuits: In his other career pursuits he did not like mistakes.  Only in art. There was one big exception. He did not like the mistake of using the art finishing product Galkyd from Gamblin Artistic Colors. Due to some unforseen circumstances and unintended use, it ruined a painting of his, turning it all yellow. He even sued the company over the damages. This is an example of a limit of his appreciation of mistakes in art.
<br><br>
            Well known as a landscape painter, Jack would often use conventions he learned as a young man from landscape paintings.  But he also worked in many of his own conventions.  He was very adventurous with his process, and enjoed taking risks and finding new ways to do things.  
<br><br>
           In his other career pursuits dad was an acomplished businessman with a serious interest in developing the early history of blue tooth and some of the computer chips used in the first years of intel. 

            <br><br> Jack Stuppin was more than just talented, he was also successful.  He's published a book of his painting available on Amazon, and he even got involed with the Art in Embassies program. 21 museams across the county are fortunate enough to own one of more of his paintings, with hundreds more in private collections. In 1992 he helped found the "Sonoma Four", a group of plein air artists from Sonoma who traveled the country to find inspiration for their art.
