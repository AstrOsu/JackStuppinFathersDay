    <h1>About the Author</h1>
    <h3> Hello my name is Jonathan Stuppin! I'm a musician and tech nerd who lives in Sonoma County, California.  This webpage was made to honor my father, Jack Stuppin.  He was a great dad.  I remember going to his studio and I'd see him working on his paintings.  In addition to taking care of me and sending me through high school and college, he would paint every single day or just about.  We also were a host family for various exchange students, including Germans and a young man from Mongolia!  I've been to Mongolian actually, and I know how to say "I don't speak much Mongolian" (Yardig Ug-Wee).
	
	He loved to sing folk songs like Keeper of the Eddystone Light to me, my mom, and also friends and buisiness partners he'd have over.  He was a buisinessman who helped do something with technology, I don't know the specifics, but he was also a stockbroker or trader in some capacity while working in New York City. But he was really famous in the years I knew him because he'd go hike and find scenery to paint.

    All my life he was traveling, even when he had gray hair.  We moved a few times, but one day I moved out and got my own place with a roommate was in 2017.  He visited me at my new place and they weren't spotty visits.  I saw him all the time but I could tell he was getting sick.  I could tell his health wasn't great.  I wanted to help him so I took basketball more seriously and he loved to watch me play.  I had tapes made of the games I played and he watched me grow into a semi decent basketball player which I could tell made him happy.  He was a tennis player even in his 50-60s so he always encouraged my athletics.  I also starting painting and that cheered him up too, along with the flowers I planted and picked for him and mommy. He was a very loving father and it's clear he wanted to see me succeed in whatever I did, and that motivated me to always keep trying new things.

      There's more school that I want to completed and more things I want to learn.  There's things he'd want me to do more of, and there's things that I don't fully understand what he would've wanted me to do.  But I'm going to proceed in pursing my education and hopefully become a public school employee or technical developer.  He was always supportive of my studies even when he didn't quite understand what I wanted to study or why.

    I took art history in seattle in my first universty,  I studied ancient italian art.  The italians did theater all throughout the weeek that centered around using masks, called the commedia dell'arte.  The masked actors would be in the market every day helping to advertise buisiness and other things.  Dad liked the art form as he also loved art history.  I made some paper masks and he decided to create these real metal masks as his own take on the Italian masks.  There were seven main characters: harlequin, his dad pantelone, the grandpa capitano, Brighella and others. 
	
	I'm currently trying to become a guitarist, currently I use an aucustic guitar. I also like ceramics, and I continue to be active as well just as my dad encouraged.
